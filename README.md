# Attendance-face-recognition
This project is a combination of ML and data analysis. A self-trained model is used to recognize faces
and the list of students is stored as data which is utilised to mark attendance. Total hours attended by the student 
are shown as a result. This project also allows to add new faces. This can be used in offices, schools, colleges, etc.
